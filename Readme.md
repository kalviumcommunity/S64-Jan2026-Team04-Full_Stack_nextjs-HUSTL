## Technology Orientation – Learnings

In this sprint, I learned how a modern full-stack application is structured using Next.js and cloud technologies.

I understood the role of Next.js in handling both frontend and backend logic, and how databases like PostgreSQL connect to the application through Prisma ORM.

I also learned how Redis improves performance through caching, how Docker ensures consistent environments, and how CI/CD with AWS or Azure helps in deploying and scaling applications.
